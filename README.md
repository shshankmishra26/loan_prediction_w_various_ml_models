## Introduction 👋
This project aims to **automate the loan qualification process** using machine learning models. Given customer data, we predict whether a loan application should be approved or rejected, streamlining decision-making for financial institutions.

## Objectives 📌
- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the dataset
- Build and evaluate multiple **ML models** for loan prediction
- Compare model performance to identify the best approach

## Machine Learning Models Used 🛠️
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
4. **Naive Bayes**
5. **Decision Tree**
6. **Random Forest**
7. **Gradient Boosting**

## Dataset 📊
The dataset contains customer details such as:
- **Loan Amount**
- **Credit History**
- **Applicant Income**
- **Employment Status**
- **Marital Status**
- **Property Area**
- And more...

## Installation 🚀
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/loan-prediction-ml.git
cd loan-prediction-ml

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Jupyter Notebook
jupyter notebook
```

## Usage 🏃‍♂️
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook and explore the dataset.
2. Run the provided ML models to train and test predictions.
3. Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results 📈
The models are evaluated based on key performance metrics, including:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision & Recall**
- **ROC-AUC Score**

The best-performing model can be used for real-time loan prediction.

## Contributing 🤝
